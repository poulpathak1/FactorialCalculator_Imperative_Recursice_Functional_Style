Assign3: Due 11:59PM April 3

The Factorial of a number is the product of all numbers in the range 1 to the number.

Write three implementations of a function to compute the Factorial of a number.

Please start with one implementation at a time rather than rushing through all
of them at the same time.

The implementations are described below:

1. An imperative iteration. 
  Given a number, loop through using traditional for.

2. A simple recursion.
  
3. A functional iteration. 
	  Use functional internal iterators to perform the operation.

Please bring forward the practices, techniques, and tools you have learned so far. This includes: 
Good code quality
Lightweight design
Minimum code
Automated testing                                                         
Code coverage
Continuous integration

Once you complete coding, please answer the following:

1. What design principles did you use in this assignment? Discuss.
